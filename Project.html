												<h3>Overview and Motivation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>_There is a project called “Nutrition and Fitness” I want to develop into the future. Nutrition and Fitness is an app which is available on mobile phones is easily used. In short, this app is used to balance the number of nutrition which people consume and support for people who are doing gymnastics. Moreover, Nutrition and Fitness also suggests for customers many options that they can reduce obesity and heart disease. It is a good option for people who want to lose weight because Nutrition and Fitness is able to calculate the amount of calories that people consume to release a best solution for customers.<br> <br>_Health plays an important role in human lives. Nonetheless, people tend to ignore their health because of the development of urban life. People are prone to consume unhealthy food in order to save time because they do not have time for cooking, which leads to the increase of heart disease and some relevant issues. For example, the University of Paris reported that there are approximately 100.000 people who consume unhealthy food every day had worse heart disease. Using Nutrition and Fitness is the cheap and easy way to reduce heart disease. Moreover, this app also guides people how to release or reduce nutrition so they can avoid overweight and obesity, and have better health status.</p>

												<h3>Description of the app</h3>
											</header>
											<p>_Nutrition and Fitness is operated on both IOS and Android. Moreover, it is free for people to download and use it. This app makes profit from the amount of downloads and users.<br> <br>_There are three main features which customers are able to choose are Diet, Lose Weight and Fitness.<br> <br>_After signing an account up for Nutrition and Fitness, it will require customers to provide their name, age, height and weight so that this app can process and calculate the calories which people can consume every meal.<br> <br>_Subsequently, customers will choose one of the three options that I mentioned above then this app will base on it to calculate exactly the amount of calories for each options.<br> <br>_Firstly, Diet is a mode for customers who aim to keep fit and maintain their health. In this mode, Nutrition and Fitness just focuses on nutrients that customers consume each meal. Every day, this app will recommend for customers dishes which are good for their health and list the nutrients which contain in these dishes. Moreover, in case that customers do not like following Nutrition and Fitness’ meals, they are able to think about what they will eat today then add to the app. This app will process and provide customers the number of calories which contains in those meals. After that, this app will give customers some advice and show the disadvantage if customers consume these dishes. <br> <br>_Secondly, this feature for people who are losing weight. Nutrition and Fitness will base on the customers’ height and weight to calculate calories. Initially, this app will require customers to provide the number of weight that they want to lose so that it could help customers to meet their goals. Nutrition and Fitness will base on these information to generate for customers a schedule and dishes per day. To be specific, the app will calculate how many hours that customers should spend on doing exercises. In addition, the app also provides plenty of delicious dishes which are good for customers’ health and balanced diet. Every week, the app will check the latest customers’ weight to compare with the previous so that Nutrition and Fitness could add some exercise lessons or change the limitation of calories per day for clients.<br> <br>_Lastly, this feature is called Fitness because it supports customers to build their bodies. However, Nutrition and Fitness will require customers to pay 20 USD per month. To be specific, it is not easy for people to have 6 packs, it is a process of doing gymnastics and maintain diet. Nonetheless, by using this app, it is easier for customers to have beautiful body shape and muscles. The Nutrition and Fitness will form a schedule of working out for customers. For example, customers will work on shoulder and back arm muscles on Monday and the app will provide some exercises for each group of muscles. Moreover, the app also provide some special meals which contains moderately amount of calories. However, there is another option for people who do not want to follow the app’s schedule, they are able to build a schedule on their own by searching the part of the muscle that they want to build or develop. After that, the app will suggest some exercises for customers to add to their schedule.</p>

												<h3>Outcome</h3>
											</header>
											<p>_If this project is successful, I believe that the number of people who have heart disease and obesity would be dramatically declined. Moreover, after using this app, customers should pay attention to their health as well as their family. From my perspective, people who are using this app would improve their health and share it to everyone so that the number of death could significantly decrease.</p>
